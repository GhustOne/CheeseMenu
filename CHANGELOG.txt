- Added feature hints
- Added support for gif, 2t1 and dds headers (old gif folders still work, all saved UIs will have no header)
- Added gradient support for features (UIs will have to be edited and resaved)
- Added customizable sizes for footer text and hint text
- Improved hotkey activation (shouldn't activate when input box is open, will add console later)
- Improved update download (thanks to Proton#5503's idea)

v1.9.2:
- Fixed bug caused by hints when there is no feature selected
